## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is a widely-used software that converts traditional fullscreen or windowed games into **borderless windowed mode**. Unlike fullscreen mode, which often causes delays and interruptions when switching between apps, borderless mode allows seamless alt-tab usage and multitasking without performance drops.

With Borderless Gaming, players can enjoy:
- Smooth transitions between applications.
- Games running in a stable, non-minimizing window.
- Better compatibility for streamers and content creators.

The software supports almost every PC game and is especially popular in titles like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, and many more. By simplifying the process of creating a **borderless window**, it ensures gamers focus on their gameplay without distractions.

Its open-source nature and free availability make Borderless Gaming a trusted choice for both casual players and professionals. Whether you’re a streamer, a competitive gamer, or someone who just wants to alt-tab freely, this software provides a reliable solution.
